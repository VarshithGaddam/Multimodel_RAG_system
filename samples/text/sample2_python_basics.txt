Python Programming Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Variables and Data Types
Python supports various data types including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Variables don't need explicit declaration and are dynamically typed.

Control Flow
Python uses if-elif-else statements for conditional execution. Loops include for loops and while loops. The indentation is significant in Python and defines code blocks.

Functions
Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword. They can accept parameters and return values. Python also supports lambda functions for simple operations.

Object-Oriented Programming
Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and objects. Classes are defined using the class keyword and can have methods and attributes.

Libraries and Frameworks
Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries including NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data analysis, and frameworks like Django and Flask for web development.
