Data Science Fundamentals

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

Data Collection and Cleaning
The first step in any data science project is collecting relevant data from various sources. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. This helps in understanding patterns, spotting anomalies, and testing hypotheses.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical methods are used to analyze and interpret data. This includes descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.

Machine Learning Models
Data scientists build predictive models using machine learning algorithms. These models can be supervised (classification, regression) or unsupervised (clustering, dimensionality reduction).

Data Visualization
Effective visualization helps communicate insights from data. Tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly are commonly used to create charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards.
