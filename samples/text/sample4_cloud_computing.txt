Cloud Computing Essentials

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

Service Models
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications. Software as a Service (SaaS) delivers software applications over the internet.

Deployment Models
Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers. Private clouds are used exclusively by a single organization. Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

Benefits of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing offers cost savings by eliminating the need for physical infrastructure. It provides scalability to handle varying workloads, reliability through redundancy, and global accessibility from anywhere with internet connection.

Major Cloud Providers
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud provider offering a wide range of services. Microsoft Azure provides integrated cloud services and infrastructure. Google Cloud Platform offers computing, storage, and application services.

Security Considerations
Cloud security involves protecting data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud. This includes encryption, access control, network security, and compliance with regulations.
